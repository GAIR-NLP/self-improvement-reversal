Offical repo for *Progress or Regress? Self-Improvement Reversal in Post-training*

# Overview
Self-improvement through post-training methods has been acclaimed for enhancing the problem-solving capabilities (e.g., mathe- matical reasoning) of Large Language Models (LLMs) without human intervention. Amidst the quest for self-improvement in LLMs, the persistent question arises: are these iterative post-training methods truly fostering progress, or are they inadvertently leading to regression?

To address this, we propose a comprehen- sive evaluative framework that goes beyond the superficial pass@1 metric to scruti- nize the underlying enhancements of post-training paradigms for self-improvement. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis across diverse problem-solving tasks, the empirical results point out the phenomenon of self-improvement reversal:
